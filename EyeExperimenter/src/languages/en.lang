This is the Go/No-Go test
A cross will appear in the center of the screen. Look at the cross.
The cross will disappear, and an arrow will appear.
If the arrow is green, quickly look at a point in the direction of the arrow. 
If the arrow is Red, you must quickly look in the opposite direction.
We will now do some practice rounds|
In this case, you should look at the point in the left|
Again, you should look at the cross|
Now, at the point in the right|
Remember to look at the cross after each trial|||;

explanation_binding_bc = 
This is the Color Combination Test
A cross will appear in the center of the screen. Look at the cross.|
The cross will disappear and some targets will appear. Remember the 
color combination of each target, After 2 seconds, the targets 
will disappear|
A new group of targets will appear|
You must identify if the color combination of each target remained the 
same or if the colors have been swapped between targets. No new colors will
appear. If the color combination is the same, you must quickly say 
‚ÄúSame‚Äù out loud. If the colors swapped from one target into another, quickly 
say ‚ÄúDifferent‚Äù. 
We will now do some practice rounds.||||||||||||||||;

explanation_binding_uc =
This is the New Colors Test
A cross will appear in the center of the screen. 
Look at the cross.|
The cross will disappear and some targets will appear. The targets 
are composed of a square of one color, with a cross in its center of 
another color. Remember the colors present in the targets.
After 2 seconds, the targets will disappear|
A new group of targets will appear|
You must identify if new colors appeared. If a new color appeared, 
you must quickly say ‚ÄúDifferent‚Äù out loud. Otherwise, say ‚ÄúSame‚Äù. 
We will now do some practice rounds.||||||||||||||||;

explanation_nbackrt =
This is the N-back RT test
The test is composed of 6 boxes and a central cross. 
Look at the cross|
A red circle will appear in one of the boxes. 
Don‚Äôt take your eyes of the cross |
The circle disappears and reappears on another box |
Finally, the circle disappears and reappears on another box. 
Remember not to take your eyes of the cross while the 
circles appear|
You must remember the location and the order in which the red circles 
appeared. When the cross disappears, you must quickly look at the box where 
the third circle appeared, then where the second one appeared, and finally 
where the first one appeared. This is the inverse order in which they appeared.
We will now do some practice rounds.|||||||||||||||;

Finally, the circle disappears and reappears on another box. 
Remember not to take your eyes of the cross while the circles appear |
You must remember the location and the order in which the red circles 
appeared. |
The cross will disappear, and a number 3 will appear. 
You must quickly look at the box where the third circle appeared. |
Then the number 2 will appear. 
Quickly look at the box where the second circle appeared. |
And finally, the number 1 will appear. 
Quickly look at the box where the first circle appeared. 
You must look at the circles in the inverse order in which they appeared.

This is the N-back Variable Speed test
The test is composed of 6 boxes and a central cross. 
Look at the cross|

Don‚Äôt take your eyes of the cross |
The circle disappears and reappears on another box |
Finally, the circle disappears and reappears on another box. 
Remember not to take your eyes of the cross while the 
circles appear|
You must remember the location and the order in which the red circles 
appeared. When the cross disappears, you must quickly look at the box where 
the last circle appeared, then where the second to last appeared and so on 
until you looked at all the boxes where circles appeared, in the inverse order.
If you hit the correct box in the sequece, it will quicly flash
