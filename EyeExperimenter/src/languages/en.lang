#********************************* Explanation Phase Text *********************************

explanation_phase_list_binding_bc =
This is the Color Combination Test. In this study, <<N>> targets will appear on the screen,
Each target has a color on the outside and a color on the inside. In this case,
remember the color combination of each target.|
The first targets will disappear and a new set of targets will appear. You must
identify if the color combination of each target remained the same or if the
colors have been swapped between targets. The position is not important.
If the colors have swapped between targets, say "Different". If not say, "Same".
In this case, the colors swapped between targets. You must say "Different"|
Look at the second example.|
In this case, color combination remained the same. You must say "Same".
Did you understand?
We will do some practice rounds before starting the test.;




explanation_phase_list_binding_uc =
This is the New Colors Test. In this study, <<N>> targets will appear on the screen,
like the targets you are seeing on the left. Each target has a color on the outside
and a color on the inside. Remember the colors present in the targets.|
The first targets will disappear and a new set of targets will appear. You have to
identify if any new colors appeared or if all the colors are the same. 
The position of the targets is not important. If new colors appeared, 
quickly say "Different" out loud. If not, say "Same". In this case, two new colors 
appeared in the center of each target. You must say "Different".|
Look at the second example.|
In this case, no new colors appeared. You must say "Same".
Did you understand?
We will do some practice rounds before starting the test.;


explanation_phase_list_gonogo     = 
This is the Go/No Go test. Look at the cross in the center of the screen.
The cross will disappears and an arrow will appear.
If the arrow is green, look in the direction of the arrow. And if it is
red, look in the opposite direction.|
In this case, because the arrow is red, look at the circle in the
opposite direction, as indicated by the blue circle.|
When the arrow disappears, quickly look back at the cross|
In this case, because the arrow is green, look in the direction of
the arrow.|
Look back at the cross|
Look in the direction of the arrow|
Back at the cross|
Look in the opposite direction. You must do this exercise as fast
as you can. Did you understand?
We will do some practice rounds before starting the test.;

explanation_phase_list_gonogo_3D = This is Go/No-Go Sphere Evaluation.
During this evaluation green and red spheres will be sent from the dark
points in front of you. Si the sphere is green you must try to touch it.
If you make contact with the sphere you will feel your controller vibrate.|
If the sphere is red, you must move your hands to avoid touching the sphere.
If contact is made anyway, then your controller will still vibrate. | 
Now try to touch the green sphere again. | 
Avoid touching the red shphere.
If you touch and avoid the spheres correctly the, spheres will start to go faster.
If your performance worsens the spheres will go slower.;




explanation_phase_list_nbackrt    =
This is the N-Back Test. The test is composed of 6 boxes and one cross in
the center of the screen. You must keep your eyes on the cross.|
A red circle will appear on one of the boxes. Position 1|
Then it will appear on another box. Position 2|
And finally on another box. Position 3. Remeber to always keep your eyes on
the cross|
When the cross disappears, you must quickly look at Position 3, where the last
circle appeared, as indicated by the arrow.|
Then look at Position 2, where the second circle appeared|
And finally, at Position 1, where the first circle appeared. In the inverse order|
When you finish, quickly look back at the cross. Now the test will be repeated|
Position 1|
Position 2|
Position 3|
Now quickly look at Position 3|
Position 2|
And Position 1. Did you understand?
We will do some practice rounds before starting the test.;


explanation_phase_list_nbackvs    = 
This is the NBack Evaluation For Training.
Red circles will appear on the screen in a given sequence.
While the cirles are being shown, please keep your eyes focused on the center cross. 
The number of circles in the sequence will depend on the selected difficulty. 
This example will use 3.|
Now, a second circle will appear.| 
Finally, the third and last circle of the sequence will be shown.|
When the cross dissapears, you must look at the rectangle where the third circle appeared. 
During the study, a flash of light will indicate that you looked a the right rectangle.
The screen will show indicators for the circle locations and the path your gaze must do.
These indicators will not be present during the real study.|
Then you must look at the rectangle where the second circle appeared before.|
Finally you must look at the rectangle where the first circle was shown. 
Successive completed sequences will decrease the time each circle is shown in the screen. 
Likewise, successive failures will increase the time the circles are shown.|
Let's try again. Fix you eyes on the center cross and notice the first red circle.|
While maintaining your eyes fixed on the cross, notice that the second circle 
appeared on the screen.|
Then the final third circle is shown|
Now look at the rectangle where the third circle was shown|
Then at the rectangle where the second one appeared|
And finish by looking at the rectangle where the first circle appeared.;
