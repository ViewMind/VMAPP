The API will function as three part address (always) followed by parameters if necessary. Always with POST.

The parts will be OBJECT/OPERATION/INDENTIFIER?other_parameters

So for example getting all doctors for an institution will look like
portal_users/getall/insitution_id

And getting all rawdata from a given institution in a given timeframe will be
rawdata/download/institution?from=date&to=date

In the same way permissions can be specified like so: For each object. 
{
   "object" : [ "operation_1",  "operation_2", ....]   
}


VMClients have the following permissions: 
{ 
   "portal_users": [ "getall" ],
   "reports" : ["generate"]   
}

        IDENTIFIER:: institution_id
            PARAMETERS: ppkey
               Returns the list of portal users associated with the institutions and the processing parameters associated with ppkey. 
               EXAMPLE: institution/operating_information/1?ppkey=htcviveeyepro
            
-> OBJECT: reports
      OPERATION: generate
         IDENTIFIER: institutution_id
            Will trigger the whole report processing.
            1) DB Update of Subject data, if necessary.
            2) Whatever checks are necessary (such as institution and instance existance, evaluations remaining)
            3) First pass at JSON File 
                - Computes fixation
                - Computes other metadata for each trial or trial set.
                - Sets other metadata such as the processing date (maybe the processing location?).
            4) Computing all Quality check values based on the frequency check parameters. 
            4) CSV Creation.
            5) R Processing. 
            6) Second pass at the JSON file that stores all results into the JSON 
            7) DB Storage of all appropiate results. 
            8) With the keyid form the evaluations table store, the JSON file in the S3.
