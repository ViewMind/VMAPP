Quality control.

Each study is composed of trials.  And each trial is composed of datasets.

So each dataset has:
   -- A minimum number of points (depends on the frequency)
   -- Consecutive timestamp points must be within two values (min, max) at all times, and when they are not that's a glitch. 
   
Average Frequency for the entire study.

So this necessitates the following values.
min_successive_timestamp_difference
max_successive_timestamp_difference

Which means that, for each Data set we can compute the following graphs:
1) Number of Points per Trial (one or the other, decide)
2) Number of Fixation per Trial (or or the other). 
3) Number of Frequency Glitches Per Trial
4) Average Frequency For trial.

So for each of these one graph with a suggested line of the recommended minimum value.

So each study has 4 parameters. 
And there is 2 which are study independant. 

qc_parameters:
   min_successive_timestamp_difference
   max_successive_timestamp_difference
   [Each Study]
      min_points_per_trial
      min_fixations_per_trial
      max_recommended_glitches.
      avg_frequecy_per_trial
