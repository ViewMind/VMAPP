What we need to do today in order to enable a product:

ViewMind, today has two servers (virtual computers provided by Amazon). Web Server (WS) and System Server (SS). Which will be referred to during this doc. 

Server Side:

ET Software Version. 
NOTE: This is all for book keeping. With the excepetion of the ET Serial Number NONE of it is needed for the system to work. 
Create an Institution if necessary. This is also where we set the number of evaluations. (WS) 
Link a product in the production list (the previous information) with an institution. (WS)  
Create a configuration file for the instace of EyeExperimenter within the institution. For this the values required:
System type: VR or GP
Instace Number: It is a counter by institution. 
Institution Name
Institution UID (Created by the sever when the institution was created).
Institution Password: (Needs to be created when the configuration file is created and will never be shown again to anyone, will not be stored, etc).
The ET serial that was used in step (1)
Create a directory for the institution in the update server and another folder within that one with the instance number. Add the changelong files in both languages, the .exe for the EyeExperimenter and a copy of the configuration file.
