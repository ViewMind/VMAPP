disclaimer = Diagnostic orientation results are an approximation. They should be expanded and verified with studies
considered appropiate by the diagnostician to measure performance/pathology;

clase_0 = Normal cognitive performance and operation. Low or null dementia risk;

clase_1 = Benign cognitive alteration. Could belong to psychological or neuropsychiatric symptoms e.g., stress, anxiety and/or depression.
For a definitive diagnosis, consultation with a psychiatrist is recommended;

clase_2 = Cognitive alteration. Could belong to neuropsychiatric symptoms e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder,
depression, anguish disorder, psycosis. Can also be caused by an organic cerebral deterioration process that is not neurodegenerative.
Consultation with a psychiatrist or neurologist is recommended;

clase_3 = Risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. Does not present alterations in cognitive functions, but does present a risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease.
Anual evaluations are recommended in order to indentify potential presence of cognitive impairment;

clase_4 = Cognitive alteration, likely due to neurodegeneration with high probability of belonging to Alzheimer's Disease.
Consultation with a neurologist is recommended;

clase_NA = The results are not conclusive;
